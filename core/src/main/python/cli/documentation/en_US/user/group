Associate groups with a user, one group at a time.  Each invocation of the group command
can either add or remove a single group to the user.   Each of the groups are simple
keywords, the group names may or may not have special meaning to the authenticator.

There are two groups which do have special rights:  the 'admin' group, and the
'reader' group.   The 'admin' group allows access to all the REST API's, allowing
the user to add or delete new users,  set passwords, and manage other RBAC rights.

The 'reader' group allows read access to all the REST API's, a user with the
'reader' group associated may view the 'show running-config' output.
