The password command associates a password with the user account.   If the single optional password parameter
is not included, the CLI will prompt for the password.   This command uses the simple password
to generated a hashed password, which will then be saved in the configuration.   The plain text
password is not saved, and impossible to regenerate once the password is entered, it will not
be included in the running-config, instead the hashed password will appear.
